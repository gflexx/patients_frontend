# Patients frontend system
Created with react
## Installation
To install, clone or pull from git, go to the root folder then:
### npm i
This installs all necessary packages
To run the server locally use:
### npm start
Make sure the django server is already running
By default it runs on:
### http://127.0.0.1:8000
If the server is not running the application will warn of a Network Error on retrieves or creations
## This is a complementary project to the patients_backend with django
To view instructions on the django server go to: https://github.com/gflexx/patients_backend
